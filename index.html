                <h1 id="history" class="reveal"> History of Music Therapy</h1><br>
                <p>Music therapy, or some form of it, has been around for centuries. Where did it start? Who started it?

Continue reading if you want to learn more about the origins of music therapy and why it is a valued practice. </p>
                <br>
                    <p>The idea of music as a healing influence which could affect health and behavior is as least as old as the writings of Aristotle and Plato and in some cultures, long before that. The 20th century profession formally began after World War I and World War II when community musicians of all types, both amateur and professional, went to Veterans hospitals around the country to play for the thousands of veterans suffering both physical and emotional trauma from the wars. The patients' notable physical and emotional responses to music led the doctors and nurses to request the hiring of musicians by the hospitals. It was soon evident that the hospital musicians needed some prior training before entering the facility and so the demand grew for a college curriculum. </p>
